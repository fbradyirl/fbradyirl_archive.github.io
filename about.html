## About

I have been working in IT for over 10 years, and have a range of experience in software development, QA and automation. Using frameworks and tools such as XCode, Objective-C, Cocoa, Java, Python plus more, I am constantly up-skilling myself in the latest cutting edge technologies. I have worked in multinationals such as Ericsson, Nortel and Cisco, and like a fresh challenge.

I am a husband and father, and am interested in cycling, soccer, beer and movies."

Born in Cavan, Ireland, citizen of the world and addicted to creating, fixing and improving stuff. My curious mind can zone out during any form of creative act and loves learning. Curious? Scroll down to check my Blog or my Timeline!
