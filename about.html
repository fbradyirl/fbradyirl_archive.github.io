## About

I have been working in IT for over 10 years, and have a range of experience in software development, QA and automation. Using frameworks and tools such as XCode, Objective-C, Cocoa, Java, Python plus more, I am constantly up-skilling myself in the latest cutting edge technologies. I have worked in multinationals such as Ericsson, Nortel and Cisco, and like a fresh challenge.

I am a husband and father, and am interested in cycling, soccer, beer and movies.
