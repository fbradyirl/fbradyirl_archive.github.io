I have been working in software engineering since 2003. Today I am working with Cisco on the [Cisco Webex Teams platform](https://developer.webex.com). Using agile, writing code, while placing a large focus on quality. In more recent years, I have been expanded also into _dev-ops_ roles, using Google Cloud Platform, containers, Kubernetes, pipeline as code. A lot of what I do is to make developers lives easier by automating the normally manual tasks and increasing the speed in which good software can be delivered to the end users.

My skillsets include Java, Python, üê≥ Docker, Jenkins, Kubernetes + more.

### my history

I have worked in Ericsson, Nortel and Cisco, among others.

I am a husband and father, and am interested in cycling, soccer, beer and movies.
