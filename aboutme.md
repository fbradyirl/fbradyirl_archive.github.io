I have been working in software engineering for over 10 years. Using agile, writing code, while placing a large focus on quality. More recently, I have moved into more _dev-opsy_ type projects, focusing on microservices and web frontend technologies for the [Cisco Spark platform](https://developer.ciscospark.com). 

My skillsets include Java, Python, Angular JS, XCode, Objective-C, Cocoa plus more. I've been told that I'm really good at ramping on new tools/techniques fast. 

### my history

I have worked in Ericsson, Nortel and Cisco, among others.

I am a husband and father, and am interested in cycling, soccer, beer and movies.
