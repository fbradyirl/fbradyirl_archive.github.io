Today, 3 of the major Irish networks, [Vodafone][1], [O2][2] and [Three][3], have released details of their iPhone 4 prices and plans.<!--more Get better service, and pay less--> They are all very different in their pricing approach, but Three seem to be getting the best response with their new tariffs.

      <p>
        These attractive iPhone 4 price plans are making some potentially new and existing iPhone consider moving over to Three.
      </p>

      <h1>
        My experiences&#8230;
      </h1>

      <p>
        I bought an iPhone 4 from the UK unlocked a month ago and decided to look for a better value and coverage alternative to O2.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Porting
      </h2>

      <p>
        I got myself a free <a href="http://www.three.ie/products_services/priceplans/prepay.htm" target="_blank">3pay</a> sim card, and ported over from O2 (my O2 18 month contract was expired). It took under 2 hours for the port to complete.
      </p>

      <p>
        <img class="alignright" title="Settings" src="http://km.support.apple.com/library/APPLE/APPLECARE_ALLGEOS/HT1970/HT1970_01-en.png" alt="" width="399" height="169" />
      </p>

      <p>
        After I sync&#8217;d the iPhone 4 with iTunes, I received a carrier update in iTunes which automatically set up all my settings for internet, MMS, and tethering on the iPhone.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now I&#8217;m paying €20 per month as opposed to the €60-70 I was paying on O2. Out of that €20, I purchase data add-ons as I need to (I even get a text to remind me when I&#8217;m low on data). Since I have wifi at home and at work, I was surprised to see how very little cellular network data I do actually use. I&#8217;m finding that €5 a month (for 500MBs) is all I need to use for data out of the €20 credit.
      </p>

      <p>
        Plus, unlike Vodafone or O2, tethering is free. Still no comment regarding Visual Voicemail from Three.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Coverage
      </h2>

      <p>
        <img class="alignleft" title="Coverage" src="http://green-blog.org/media/images/2008/02/tower-tube3.jpg" alt="" width="197" height="200" />I find that Three&#8217;s network coverage is better <em>for me</em> than O2, in the places <strong>where I most need it</strong>. I am getting 3G in the places where I was only getting &#8216;EDGE&#8217; on O2. Now, this will differ from person to person according to where you live/work. I know there are black spots in certain areas in the country where there doesn&#8217;t seem to be any data coverage (although there seems to be voice coverage everywhere I&#8217;ve been so far).
      </p>

      <p>
        So my advice would be to walk into a Three store and grab a free 3pay sim card and pop it into your current phone. Then you can measure the signal strength in the places <strong>where it is most important for you</strong>. If you&#8217;re happy, then make the switch. If you&#8217;re not happy, then go elsewhere.
      </p>

      <h2>
        <em>Other things I like about Three</em>
      </h2>

      <p>
        &#8211; I am often going up north, so it&#8217;s nice that I don&#8217;t ever have to worry about roaming charges (for voice and data).
      </p>

      <p>
        &#8211; I used the Speedtest.net app on both O2 and Three on my iPhone and consistently get double the speed on Three 3G (3.5MB downlink) in Galway.
      </p>

      <p>
        &#8211; Three have the national broadband scheme so their 3G can only get better, whereas in the past few years on O2 I haven&#8217;t noticed any improvements in coverage.
      </p>

      <p>
        Overall, I&#8217;m happy I made the move to Three. I can&#8217;t see any argument against my move from O2. After all, I am getting better service, and paying a lot less for it.
      </p>
