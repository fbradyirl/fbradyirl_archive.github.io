I&#8217;m very excited to finally getting around to setting up my own personal website and blog.

I am hoping to use this space to post and share helpful developer tips and tricks relating to iPhone OS and also Java development and general tips and tricks. I also want to learn from you, the reader and your experiences&#8230;

I have been developing on the Mac for some years now and on the iPhone for almost 2. I am self thought at Objective-C and Cocoa, so am happy to share what I&#8217;ve learn&#8217;t along the way.

I also have to mention the folks over at [3essentials.com][1] who were absolutely fantastic help in migrating all of my sites to a new server, providing great support all along.

Cheers,

Finbarr
