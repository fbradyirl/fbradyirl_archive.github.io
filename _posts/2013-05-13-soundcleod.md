<img class="alignright" alt="" src="https://raw.github.com/salomvary/soundcleod/master/soundcleod.iconset/icon_128x128.png" width="128" height="128" />Since SoundCloud quietly <a href="https://twitter.com/ceterum_censeo/status/292964333569310721" target="_blank">discontinued</a> their Mac App Store app, I&#8217;ve been looking for alternatives. I found an open source app called SoundCleod. Although it is simply a web view wrapper, it provides a proper dock icon, and you can use all the playback keys on your keyboard, which is essentially all I want from a music app.

Like the sound of it? Go grab [SoundCleod][1] for free.
