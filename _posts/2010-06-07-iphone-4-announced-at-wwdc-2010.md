Announced at WWDC 2010 by Steve Jobs today and making it&#8217;s way to Ireland in July, is the new iPhone 4.<!--more-->The follow up to 2009&#8217;s iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4 packs some serious hardware upgrades with a front and back glass enclosure, a front facing camera for video calling, a 5 megapixel camera with flash on the back, and containing Apple&#8217;s own A4 processor inside. Video calling will only work over wifi in 2010 but will work over 3G later after testing on cellular networks is done.

The iPhone 4 is 25% thinner than the 3GS and will have the ability to record and edit HD video. It also will come preloaded with iPhone OS 4 which Apple has now renamed iOS 4 (because it now runs on multiple devices such as the iPad as well as iPhones and the iPod Touch).

I&#8217;m looking forward to upgrading my dated iPhone 3G! Roll on July&#8230;
