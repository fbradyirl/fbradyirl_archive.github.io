New Wifi iPad owners are finding that when they leave the house, it can be hard to find a Wifi hotspot and get connected.<!--more-->

But what about the iPhone in their pocket? Wouldn&#8217;t it be great if I could share the iPhone internet connection over Wifi with my shiny new iPad? Even when the 3G iPad comes out, who wants to pay an extra $30 a month for another data plan on top of all my other bills?

You may think that tethering will just work already as it does over USB or Bluetooth between your iPhone & laptop. Wrong. Steve Jobs has [spoken][1] and the man says &#8220;No&#8221;.

<a rel="shadowbox" href="http://finbarr.dev/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/MyWiWeb1_2.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-271" title="MyWiWeb1_2" src="http://finbarr.dev/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/MyWiWeb1_2-176x300.png" alt="" width="176" height="300" /></a>I thought I had seen the last of jailbreaking, especially after hearing about iPhone OS 4.0, but now it looks like I will be doing it again. The last time I jailbroke was to use PDANet to enable tethering when I was without broadband in my old house. This time it will be for similar reasons, but for *outside* the house.

Available only on the Cydia store, [MyWi][2] lets you create a WiFi Hotspot to share your iPhone&#8217;s internet connection and to connect your iPad (or mutiple devices) to the web.

I haven&#8217;t received my iPad (it&#8217;s not yet available in Ireland) so I haven&#8217;t had a chance to try it, but judging by the last few posts on [this forum][3], it looks like it works very well for iPad users.

Are you interested in using this or are you going to sign up for a 3G data plan? Let me know in the comments.
