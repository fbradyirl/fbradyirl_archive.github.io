## Replacing the Eir F2000 Router

Recently, I was lucky enough to get Fibre To The Home (FTTH) connected at my abode, and was kindly provided a wireless router from Eir. It is the Huawei F2000.

From the user guide:

> The eir F2000 eir Fibre Modem is a next generation voice gateway that supports very-high-data-rate digital subscriber line 2 (VDSL2) uplink, one Giga Ethernet uplink port and 4 Giga Ethernet downlink ports.
