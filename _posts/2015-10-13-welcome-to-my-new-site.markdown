A new site you might ask! Well, my old web server got hacked, bigtime, and I'm growing a bit tired
of `Wordpress`. So, I decided to give Jekyll a try, as I like the sound of GitHub managing
the hosting (and all the security patches around that!)


Jekyll offers some cool features such as powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll’s dedicated Help repository][jekyll-help].
