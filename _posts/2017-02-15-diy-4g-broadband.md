# "Upgrade" your home internet connection to LTE

Over the past year or so, I have talked to a number of people, who are struggling with their home 'broadband' setup. Everyone has tried a wired connection, be it fibre, DSL or cable. However, if are not in an area covered by Virgin _(formally UPC)_ cable or if you are more than a kilometer or two from your nearest exchange or green cabinet, then you are realistically only to get a trickle of the speeds promosed by the Irish telcos in their drive to push 'fibre' speeds. 

I was also in this same position when I moved into my home a couple of years back. I tried fixed line (with Vodafone) at first. Then WiMax (with AirWire), but in the end, I settled on 4G LTE. But how did I set that up? Read on...

## Hardware
First, you will need one of these two options:
1. a built in LTE modem (and SIM card slot) OR
2. an older router which can support an LTE dongle modem, plugged into the USB slot of the router.

Lets start with the easier option, option 1.

There are several LTE routers out there, but one I have heard good things about is this [TP-Link one on Amazon](http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B016ZWXYXG/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_x_imiPybQ6E4TDW). That is a pretty standard, carrier unlocked, router which also gives you wireless N connectivity to the devices in your home. It also has support for unscrewing those rabbit ear antennas, to pop in your own at a later stage (we will discuss this later on...).
