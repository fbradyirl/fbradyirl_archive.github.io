## "Upgrade" your home internet connection to LTE

Over the past year or so, I have talked to a number of people, who are struggling with their home 'broadband' setup. Everyone has tried a wired connection, be it fibre, DSL or cable. However, if are not in an area covered by Virgin _(formally UPC)_ cable or if you are more than a kilometer or two from your nearest exchange or green cabinet, then you are realistically only to get a trickle of the speeds promosed by the Irish telcos in their drive to push 'fibre' speeds. 

I was also in this same position when I moved into my home, and tried fixed line (with Vodafone), WiMax (with AirWire), but in the end, I settled on 4G LTE. But how did I set that up?
