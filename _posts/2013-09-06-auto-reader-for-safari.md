Safaris **Reader** feature is one of the main reasons I use Safari most of the time, on my Mac. I also use Chrome (mainly for its syncing features), but I always come back to Safari when doing any serious news trawling.

I built this handy little Safari extension, based on example code from Apple. [Download the extension here.][1]
