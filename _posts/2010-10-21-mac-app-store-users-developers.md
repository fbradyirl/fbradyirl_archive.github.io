Apple yesterday announced that they are bringing an [App Store][1] to the Mac. Coming in 3 months, the Mac App Store will be available to existing Snow Leopard users, allowing them to quickly browse the market, read reviews, view screenshots and purchase both free and paid apps.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-510" title="appstore_overview20101020" src="http://finbarr.dev/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/appstore_overview20101020.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="396" />

The system will be very similar to the iOS App Store but will lead to a fundamental change in the way desktop users source their applications.

Here are some of the key points:

  * *Developers can distribute their applications via the Mac App Store AND via traditional means such as from their website or using optical media.*
  * *Licensing of applications will extend to all of the users Macs.* E.g. buy once, run on every Mac in the house. This could be a deal breaker for many firms that rely on complex licensing systems (like a family pack), or who want to implement their own DRM.
  * <img class="alignright size-full wp-image-518" title="appstore_update20101020" src="http://finbarr.dev/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/appstore_update20101020.jpg" alt="" width="106" height="99" />*Users will be notified of app updates automatically*. It remains to be seen if developers will be allowed to charge for major revisions of their software (unlike iOS). Again, this could be a deal breaker.
  * *Applications must be built using Apple own tools (XCode), and must not be programmed in Java or Rosetta (legacy) technologies.* This is fair enough, and to be expected, given Apples ignorance towards Java in the past 3-4 years. Also, to put the final nail in the Java/Apple coffin, they stated yesterday in the Java &#8216;Update 3&#8217; release notes, that Java &#8220;may be removed from future versions of Mac OS X.&#8221;
  * *The same 70% (developer) / 30% (Apple) split applies on sales in the store.* No fee for free applications.
  * *Apps that use private APIs, crash,  will be rejected.*
  * *All the usual rules about privacy and location based services apply.*
One of the main problems for me when I moved from Windows to Mac about 6 years ago, was &#8220;where do I find software?&#8221;. Even to this day, it can be daunting trying to find an image manipulation program that works for my needs. When the app store comes along, I&#8217;ll be able to find that program in 3 clicks, read reviews, and download it if I like it. Google is great for search, but it&#8217;s not that great [as a store front][2].

For developers, this opens up a new revenue stream. Ok, we will now be keeping 70%, and giving 30% of sales to Apple, as opposed to keeping 100% before. If you can&#8217;t deal with that, then stay away from the Apple model. Stick with your website or CD distribution methods. Or maybe sell it on both, while charging a slight premium for the App Store version to make up for the lost 30%. At the end of the day, you will get more eyeballs on your product and this can only be a good thing.

Also, for small developers like myself, who have relied on donations to keep projects running, I now have an option to charge a small fee for an app, without having to set up any payment system, dealing with refunds, setting up DRM, etc etc&#8230;

I know a small portion of nerds don&#8217;t want this to happen, and may abondon the Mac because of it. Maybe they feel like they are losing control of the Mac. I don&#8217;t think so.

For the vast majority of normal users, this is good. This bridges the gap between developers and users, and I for one, welcome our new app store overlords.
