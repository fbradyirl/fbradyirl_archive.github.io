Apple have upgraded a number of the internals in the latest iPhone release, including the camera, the lens system, the processor, and a new *dual band, intelligent switching antenna design supporting *<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolved_HSPA" target="_blank">HSPA+</a> **.

In theory, the new phone supports a theoretical maximum download speed of up to 14.4 Mbps. This is a pretty insane speed for a mobile device, if your network even supports it, and if it is available in your area. To give you a comparison, my **fixed line** broadband connection at home only goes so far as 8Mbps downlink maximum, but normally averages out at about 3-4Mbps in reality (Eircom).

My current mobile provider is <a title="Three Irl" href="http://three.ie/" target="_blank">3 Ireland</a>, which is known to have rolled out HSPA+ on certain parts of its network.

So I decided to run a simple test, using the <a href="http://www.speedtest.net/mobile.php" target="_blank">SpeedTest.net app</a>, to test the data speeds on the iPhone 4 and on the iPhone 4S at the same location (in Galway) around the same time of the day. *A*ll background apps are closed and wifi is disabled. Here are the findings:

Basically, I ran 38 speed tests on each device, averaged them out, and compared the results.

So it looks like we can get vastly faster speeds with the 4S. It&#8217;s hard to know if that&#8217;s the HSPA+ kicking in, or is it because of the dual core A5 power making everything faster overall? What do you think? I&#8217;d be interested in your comments.

Either way, I&#8217;m getting about the same speeds now on my mobile as on my fixed line broadband. Time to ditch Eircom and go Personal Hotspot full time? *That idea is beginning to become plausible.*
